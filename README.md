# Clarity vs. Solidity

**Clarity** is the programming language for creating smart contracts and dApps in the Bitcoin Web3 ecosystem, published to the [Stacks blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/). It was designed to make the handling of assets on a blockchain as safe, secure, and predictable as possible while also empowering developers to build the next generation of blockchain applications.

It was created 6 years after **Solidity**, the first-ever smart contract programming language for blockchain programs that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is the most widely used programming language in Web3. 

## Why should we care about { Clarity | Solidity }?

Rekt keeps a [leaderboard of smart contract hacks](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/)—it's not pretty. There have been multiple half billion or more hacks in 2022 alone. These are largely Solidity-based dApps and bridges connecting EVM-compatible chains.

Clarity is the answer to the question: What would a predictable, secure smart contract programming language look like that incorporates the painful lessons of the first generation of decentralized finance and NFTs?

## This repo

This repo contains a few contracts and scripts that demonstrate similar functionality—say, incrementing a counter, or withdrawing a user's balance from another contract—and compares their implementation in the two languages.

Contained within is the [*Clarity vs. Solidity Workshop* PDF document](/assets/Clarity_vs_Solidity_Workshop.pdf) shared on in September 2022.
